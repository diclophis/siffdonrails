Siffd is a trip planner which pulls event information from yahoo's upcoming.org

Siffd uses Yahoo's newest web api the Yahoo Query Language (YQL) to pull back event info. YQL greatly resembles SQL so a new database adapter was built enabling the creation active-record classes which represent various Yahoo APIs. 

The following code exposes the Upcoming API through active-record:

class UpcomingCategory < YahooBase
  set_table_name "upcoming.category"
end

Now you can view upcoming categories:
UpcomingCategory.find :all

Events would be similar:
class UpcomingEvent < YahooBase
  set_table_name "upcoming.event"
end

UpcomingEvent.find :all

At the moment, conditionals can only be exposed via array notation:
UpcomingCategory.find(:all, :conditions => ['name = ?',  'Music'])
 
There is quite a bit of work that needs to be done before the adapter is fully functional.
